#hello-world
Hello everyone. Quai here. I'm trying to learn more about GitHub. I majored in psychology in college, but I also did a computer science "concentration," which is less courses than a minor. I wish I would have double majored in computer science because I like it so much. Now I'm trying to make up for lost time by teaching myself some things. I taught myself Basic and learned a bit of Java, Ruby on Rails, SQL, HTML/CSS, and some command prompt stuff in school. I think that was a decent start, but I've forgotten a lot. Now I'm trying to get back into programming. I guess that's enough for now. Back to the tutorial.
#Goodbye world
That's it for now
